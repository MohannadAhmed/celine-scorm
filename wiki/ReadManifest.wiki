#summary To read and print the IMS manifest structure.

= Introduction =

A basic feature of CELINE is reading an IMS manifest. This page examplifies how it is possible read a manifest and print the titles of the items.

First, we need to download the following files from [https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzNO6qBfK-pGOWY1bV9KYUNvaGc&usp=sharing here]:
  * celine.jar
  * commons-digester`*`.jar
  * commons-logging`*`.jar
  * commons-beanutils`*`.jar

Then, we create the reader. Because CELINE supports different SCORM versions, the reader is created by a factory.
{{{
ContentPackageReader cpr = ContentPackageReaderFactory.getContentPackageReader("imsmanifest.xml");
}}}

Now, it is time to load the file and get the default organization.
{{{
ContentPackage cp = cpr.read("imsmanifest.xml");
Organization org = cp.getOrganizations().getDefaultOrganization();
Iterator<Item> items = org.getChildren();
}}}

Finally, iterates by the items.
{{{
while (items.hasNext()) {
  
  Item item = items.next();
  System.out.println(item.getTitle());

}
}}}
